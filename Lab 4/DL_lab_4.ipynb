stayed professional and friendly until the end.\\t1\\n', b'From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.\\t1\\n', b'On the ground, right next to our

and the prices were very reasonable.\\t1\\n', b\"I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.\\t0\\n\", b'This is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged, then another 35 minutes to get our food...and they kept forgetting things.\\t0\\n', b'Love the margaritas, too!\\t1\\n', b'This was my first and only Vegas buffet and it did not

the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas!\\t1\\n', b'We waited for thirty minutes to be seated (although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting).\\t0\\n', b'The

have much rather gone.\\t0\\n', b\"I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.\\t1\\n\", b'An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.\\t1\\n', b\"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check.\\t0\\n\", b'This place is disgusting!\\t0\\n', b'The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.\\t0\\n', b'The kids play area is NASTY!\\t0\\n', b'My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.\\t1\\n', b'I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.\\t0\\n', b\"Based on the sub-par service I received and no

stayed professional and friendly until the end.\\t1\\n', b\"I wasn't really impressed with Strip Steak.\\t0\\n\", b\"Plus, it's only 8 bucks.\\t1\\n\", b'However, my recent experience at this particular location was not so good.\\t0\\n', b'The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome...

b'This place has it!\\t1\\n', b'I had a pretty satifying experience.\\t1\\n', b'So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.\\t0\\n', b'will definitely be back!\\t1\\n', b'Service sucks.\\t0\\n', b'This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.\\t1\\n', b'The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.\\t1\\n', b\"Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.\\t0\\n\", b'Terrible management.\\t0\\n', b'I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat.\\t0\\n', b\"I gave it 5 stars then, and I'm giving it 5 stars now.\\t1\\n\", b'I got food poisoning here at the buffet.\\t0\\n', b'The staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown

give it zero stars.\\t0\\n', b'An absolute must visit!\\t1\\n', b'Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.\\t0\\n', b'Very poor service.\\t0\\n', b\"They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.\\t0\\n\", b'Seriously killer hot chai latte.\\t1\\n', b'Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.\\t1\\n', b'This was like the final blow!\\t0\\n', b'The cr\\xc3\\xaape was delicate and thin and moist.\\t1\\n', b\"I'd love to go back.\\t1\\n\", b'The scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well.\\t0\\n', b'Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.\\t0\\n', b'This place deserves no stars.\\t0\\n', b\"I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.\\t1\\n\", b\"My girlfriend's veal was very bad.\\t0\\n\", b'The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.\\t1\\n', b\"I've had better atmosphere.\\t0\\n\", b'The turkey and roast beef were bland.\\t0\\n', b'The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an \"Are you being helped?\"\\t0\\n',

will be back for a very long time.\\t0\\n', b'I miss it and wish they had one in Philadelphia!\\t1\\n', b'But then they came back cold.\\t0\\n', b'After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.\\t0\\n', b'I immediately said I wanted to talk to the manager but I did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar.\\t0\\n', b'The Buffet at Bellagio was far from what I anticipated.\\t0\\n', b'We will not be coming back.\\t0\\n', b'I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.\\t1\\n', b'Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant!\\t1\\n', b'Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!\\t1\\n', b'I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack.\\t0\\n', b'This is a GREAT place to eat!\\t1\\n', b'Similarly, the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late.\\t0\\n', b'Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.\\t0\\n', b'the food is not tasty at all, not to say its \"real traditional Hunan style\".\\t0\\n', b'The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.\\t0\\n', b\"You won't be disappointed.\\t1\\n\", b'The atmosphere here is fun.\\t1\\n', b'Nothing special.\\t0\\n', b'Join the club and get awesome offers via email.\\t1\\n', b'The food was terrible.\\t0\\n', b'The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.\\t1\\n', b'Great food and service, huge portions and they give a military discount.\\t1\\n', b\"I can't tell you how disappointed I was.\\t0\\n\", b\"It's worth driving up from Tucson!\\t1\\n\", b'Love this place, hits the spot when I want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor.\\t1\\n', b'Very Very Disappointed ordered the $35 Big Bay Plater.\\t0\\n', b'This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.\\t0\\n', b'This place was such a nice surprise!\\t1\\n', b'Reasonably priced also!\\t1\\n', b'I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.\\t1\\n', b'The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table.\\t1\\n', b'If you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service, then this is the place for you.\\t0\\n', b'We literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order.\\t0\\n', b'The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.\\t1\\n', b'Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.\\t1\\n', b\"Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.\\t1\\n\", b'This is my new fav Vegas buffet spot.\\t1\\n', b'They dropped more than the ball.\\t0\\n', b'I really enjoyed eating here.\\t1\\n', b'(The bathroom is just next door and very nice.)\\t1\\n', b'All the bread is made in-house!\\t1\\n', b'Nargile - I think you are great.\\t1\\n', b'Just as good as when I had it more than a year ago!\\t1\\n', b'I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.\\t1\\n', b'I give it 2 thumbs down\\t0\\n', b\"this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.\\t0\\n\", b'seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.\\t0\\n', b'Will not be back.\\t0\\n', b'The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.\\t1\\n', b'We got sitting fairly fast, but, ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order, another 30 minutes before the food arrived.\\t0\\n', b'The classic Maine Lobster Roll was fantastic.\\t1\\n', b\"If you haven't gone here GO NOW!\\t1\\n\", b\"Overall I wasn't very impressed with Noca.\\t0\\n\", b'Went for lunch - service was slow.\\t0\\n', b'AN HOUR... seriously?\\t0\\n', b'No complaints!\\t1\\n', b'Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.\\t1\\n', b'Love the margaritas, too!\\t1\\n', b'This place is horrible and way overpriced.\\t0\\n', b'The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.\\t1\\n', b'for 40 bucks a head, i

friendly.\\t1\\n', b'Sorry, I will not be getting food from here anytime soon :(\\t0\\n', b'Food was really boring.\\t0\\n', b'I\\'m so happy to be here!!!\"\\t1\\n', b'The chicken I got was definitely reheated and was only ok, the wedges were cold and soggy.\\t0\\n', b'Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.\\t1\\n', b'From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.\\t1\\n', b'However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.\\t0\\n', b'I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.\\t1\\n', b\"I'm not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place.\\t0\\n\", b\"I promise they won't disappoint.\\t1\\n\", b'It also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it.\\t0\\n', b'If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.\\t0\\n', b'Stopped by this place while in Madison for the Ironman, very friendly, kind staff.\\t1\\n', b'Food was really good and I got full petty fast.\\t1\\n', b'There is nothing authentic about this place.\\t0\\n', b\"These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.\\t1\\n\", b'They have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich, a crispy chicken wrap, a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers.\\t1\\n', b'Which are small and not worth the price.\\t0\\n', b'Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!\\t1\\n', b'Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!\\t1\\n', b'The waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for vegan/veggie options.\\t1\\n', b'For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.\\t1\\n', b'We definately enjoyed ourselves.\\t1\\n', b'This is a good joint.\\t1\\n', b'Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.\\t1\\n', b'All in all, Ha Long Bay was a bit of a flop.\\t0\\n', b'Mediocre food.\\t0\\n', b'Never again will I be dining at this place!\\t0\\n', b'What a mistake.\\t0\\n', b'Service is also cute.\\t1\\n', b'My boyfriend and I came here for the first time on a recent trip to Vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service.\\t1\\n', b'I am far from a sushi connoisseur but I can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food.\\t0\\n', b'OMG, the food was delicioso!\\t1\\n', b'The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.\\t0\\n', b'There is nothing privileged about working/eating there.\\t0\\n', b'The cocktails are all handmade and delicious.\\t1\\n', b'Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.\\t0\\n', b\"The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.\\t0\\n\", b\"I don't think I'll be running back to Carly's anytime soon for food.\\t0\\n\", b'The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.\\t0\\n', b'I was so insulted.\\t0\\n', b\"Worst food/service I've had in a while.\\t0\\n\", b'Before I go in to why I gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at Bachi burger before writing a review.\\t0\\n', b\"This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.\\t1\\n\", b'Very, very sad.\\t0\\n', b'My sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless.\\t0\\n', b'The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).\\t0\\n', b\"Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.\\t0\\n\", b'The chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat I have ever eaten.\\t0\\n', b'Awesome selection of beer.\\t1\\n', b'Eclectic selection.\\t1\\n', b\"But I don't like it.\\t0\\n\", b'The service was extremely slow.\\t0\\n', b'So they performed.\\t1\\n', b'It was extremely \"crumby\" and pretty tasteless.\\t0\\n', b'It took over 30 min to get their milkshake, which was nothing more than chocolate milk.\\t0\\n', b'All of the tapas dishes were delicious!\\t1\\n', b'Weird vibe from owners.\\t0\\n', b'Will not be back!\\t0\\n', b'Unfortunately, it was not good.\\t0\\n', b\"If someone orders two tacos don't' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart?\\t0\\n\", b\"I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.\\t0\\n\", b'Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.\\t1\\n', b\"It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.\\t0\\n\", b\"That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.\\t1\\n\", b'Waitress was sweet and funny.\\t1\\n', b'The cashier had no care what so

because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.\\t0\\n\", b\"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!\\t1\\n\", b'Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.\\t0\\n', b\"Each day of the week they have a different deal and it's all so delicious!\\t1\\n\", b\"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.\\t0\\n\", b'Worst service to boot, but that is the least of their worries.\\t0\\n', b'The bartender was also nice.\\t1\\n', b'This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.\\t0\\n', b'The bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated.\\t1\\n', b'No allergy warnings on the menu,

OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.\\t0\\n', b'The nachos are a MUST HAVE!\\t1\\n', b\"I'm not eating here!\\t0\\n\", b\"Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but

lot!\\t1\\n', b\"The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.\\t0\\n\", b'Waiter was a jerk.\\t0\\n', b'Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.\\t0\\n', b'The roast beef sandwich tasted really good!\\t1\\n', b'I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.\\t1\\n', b'My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.\\t1\\n', b'I believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi.\\t1\\n', b'This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.\\t0\\n', b\"I'm super pissd.\\t0\\n\", b'This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!\\t0\\n', b'She was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.\\t0\\n', b'What happened next was pretty....off putting.\\t0\\n', b'Total brunch fail.\\t0\\n', b'The steak was amazing...rge fillet

very tasty to me.\\t0\\n\", b'Both of them were truly unbelievably good, and I am so glad we went back.\\t1\\n', b'They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly

years ago and was not impressed.\\t0\\n', b'Not a weekly haunt, but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while.\\t1\\n', b'The bus boy on the other hand was so rude.\\t0\\n',

towards other guests as well.\\t0\\n', b'I was mortified.\\t0\\n', b'Strike 2, who wants to be rushed.\\t0\\n', b'The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.\\t0\\n',

seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.\\t1\\n', b\"It's too bad the food is so damn generic.\\t0\\n\", b'When I received my Pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there.\\t1\\n', b\"I also had to taste my Mom's multi-grain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing, fluffy, and delicious!\\t1\\n\", b'Not good for the money.\\t0\\n', b\"And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.\\t1\\n\", b'We waited for forty five minutes in vain.\\t0\\n', b'Great pork sandwich.\\t1\\n', b'Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.\\t0\\n', b'WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.\\t0\\n', b'Def coming
